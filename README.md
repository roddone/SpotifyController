*This project is **dead** since Spotify removed its unofficial local API which allows to control SPotify application.*

# Spotify Local Controller

This software allows you to control a local Spotify Instance

Note : The Spotify Instance must be running on the same computer

### Concept
  If you're working in an open-space, you probably listen music all day. But you should also Play/pause the music every time a co-worker needs to speek.
  This Software allows you to access the basic controls of your spotify player at any time, even when the player is minified.

### How To

The software is designed to appear centered on the top of the screen, showing the current played song. 

Simply "mouse-over" the green bordered black rectangle to expand the tool box which contains the action buttons.

You can move the window by using the "Windows + Arrows" keyboard shortcut
